# Project Brief: Spades Game (Cline-Powered)

## Overview

This project is a single-player HTML5 + JavaScript implementation of the classic card game Spades. It is developed as a passion project to explore and evaluate the capabilities of **Cline** for use in coding, testing, and automation workflows.

The initial focus is on a functional browser-based game, with potential future expansion into multiplayer or server-based gameplay. This document outlines the current technical scope, development environment, and goals.

## Current State

- **Stage**: Early development  
- **Gameplay Mode**: Single-player  
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **HTML5** for the front-end structure
  - **JavaScript** for logic and interactivity
  - **Custom Testing Framework** located in `js/test`
- **Tooling**: Cline is being integrated to handle:
  - Automated test execution
  - Code scaffolding and refactoring
  - Project structure management

## Objectives

- Implement core Spades gameplay mechanics.
   - The file `docs/gameRules.md` contains the canonical list of gameplay rules to be enforced during development.
- Use Cline for:
  - Writing and managing modular game logic
  - Building and running automated tests
  - Automating repetitive coding tasks
- Build a modular, maintainable codebase with clean separation of concerns (e.g., card logic, player AI, game flow).
- Validate game logic through unit tests and gameplay simulations.

## Future Possibilities

- Expand to multiplayer by introducing a backend server.
- Enhance UI/UX with real-time feedback, animations, and responsive design.
- Evaluate whether future server support will be integrated or spun off into a separate project.
