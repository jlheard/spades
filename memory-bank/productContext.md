# Product Context: Spades Game (Cline Evaluation Project)

## Purpose

This project exists as a **passion project** designed to explore the capabilities of **Cline** in real-world, iterative software development. The primary aim is to assess how well Cline can engage with an **existing, unfinished project** and support it through to completion.

Rather than starting from scratch, this project presents Cline with partial, evolving code — reflecting the reality of many creative, hobby-driven development efforts. It is intentionally open-ended and incomplete to test how well Cline can adapt to changing requirements, identify gaps, propose improvements, and deliver working functionality across iterations.

## Role of Cline

Cline is being evaluated on its ability to:

- **Understand context**: Work within an existing codebase and development environment, including custom structures and frameworks.
- **Drive progress**: Suggest and implement next steps without needing full specifications upfront.
- **Handle iteration**: Adapt as new goals emerge and the game becomes more complex.
- **Automate testing**: Integrate tightly with the project’s custom testing framework to ensure quality.
- **Support creative coding**: Enable the developer to stay in flow while offloading boilerplate, test writing, and basic scaffolding tasks.

## Current Scope

- Focus is on a **single-player HTML5 + JavaScript Spades game**.
- The project includes:
  - Core game logic (cards, players, rules)
  - A custom testing framework (`js/test`)
  - Basic UI scaffolding
- Cline is used to help write, refactor, test, and organize code as needed.

## Long-Term Vision

While this version is single-player, the project may eventually evolve into a multiplayer web app — either as an extension of this project or a new one. Regardless, the primary goal remains testing how well Cline can grow alongside the codebase through natural development phases.

This is not a commercial product — it’s an experiment in **pair-programming with AI**.
