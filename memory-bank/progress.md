# Progress - Spades (Single Player Implementation)

This document provides a summary of the current progress, goals, and future steps in the development of the Spades game, based on the context outlined in the previous files (Game Rules, System Patterns, Technical Context).

## Current Progress

### Game Development

- **Game Rules Implementation**: 
  - The core game rules are mostly implemented but we've identified specific issues during gameplay testing:
    - **Critical Bug**: Players cannot play spades when they don't have the leading suit (clubs), which contradicts the game rules. ✅ FIXED
    - **Critical Bug**: Human player's hand wasn't updating correctly when a computer player led a trick, allowing invalid plays. ✅ FIXED
    - **UI Issue**: The winning card animation works, but the value of the card isn't displayed properly.
  - These issues need to be fixed to ensure the game follows the official rules as documented in `docs/gameRules.md`.

- **Card Logic**:
  - Card comparison and game flow are functioning based on the rules, but there are edge cases that aren't handled correctly.
  - The rule that "If a player has no cards in the suit led, they may play any card, including jokers and spades" is not being properly enforced.
  - **Critical Bug**: Identified and fixed issue where spadesBroken flag was incorrectly reset after each trick, causing valid plays to run out.
  - **Architectural Improvement**: Moved spadesBroken state from Turn to Game class for better design and state persistence.

- **UI/UX**:
  - Changed hand sorting to display cards in descending order (highest value first) to match how most players read cards from left to right. This change has been documented in CHANGELOG.md, README.md, and docs/gameRules.md.
  - The winning card animation (gold glow and pulse) works correctly, but the card value doesn't display properly during the animation.
  - The game's current UI does not clearly show what cards have been played, making it difficult to follow the flow of the game.

### Testing and Automation

- **QUnit Migration Completed**:
  - Successfully migrated from the custom testing framework to QUnit.
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the migration process in `/docs/test-migration-guide.md`.
  - Added an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `/docs/adr/001-migration-to-qunit.md`.
  - Implemented sample QUnit tests for both unit and integration testing.
  - Fixed integration tests for "Complete trick flow with rule enforcement" and "Winning card determination and animation".
  - All tests now run through a Python server on port 8000 as documented in `/docs/browserServerConfig.md`.
  
- **Test Coverage Gaps Identified**: 
  - Despite passing tests, gameplay testing revealed issues that weren't caught by our test suite.
  - Need to add specific tests for edge cases like playing spades when the player has no cards of the leading suit.
  - Need to add tests for UI elements and animations to ensure they display correctly.

## Goals Moving Forward

### Phase 2 Goals (Updated April 12, 2025)

1. **Complete Unit Test Suite**: ✅
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all core components
   - Tested all public methods and key functionality
   - Ensured test coverage for all game logic
   - Used manual verification to track test coverage
   - All tests are now passing

2. **Improve Test Reliability**: ✅
   - Added documentation about refreshing the page to ensure tests pass consistently
   - Updated testing-notes.md with guidance on browser caching and state persistence
   - Added specific instructions for running tests through the Python server
   - Documented common testing pitfalls and best practices

3. **Fix Joker Naming Consistency Issues**: ✅
   - Fixed joker card creation in trickWinning.test.js to use correct rank names ('BigJoker' and 'ExtraJoker')
   - Updated gameRules.md to clarify the naming discrepancy between documentation and code implementation
   - Enhanced testing-notes.md with specific examples of correct joker card creation
   - Added documentation about joker naming conventions to prevent future test failures
   - Ensured all tests consistently use the correct joker rank names

4. **Fix Rule Enforcement Issues**: ✅
   - Created specific tests for the identified rule enforcement bug
   - Fixed the logic in `LegalPlayRules.isCardLegalToPlay()` and related methods
   - Ensured players can play spades when they don't have the leading suit
   - Verified the fix works in both tests and actual gameplay

5. **Improve UI/Animation**: ✅
   - Fixed the failing integration test for player positions
   - Fixed the card value display during winning animations
   - Enhanced the winning card animation for better visibility
   - Ensured card content remains visible throughout animations
   - Added "WINNER" label to winning card animation

6. **Fixed Card Comparison Logic**: ✅
   - Fixed bug in `cardComparer.js` where the highest spade wasn't correctly identified when multiple spades were present
   - Updated the logic to correctly compare cards of the same suit
   - Ensured the Ace of Spades wins when multiple spades are present

7. **Create Integration Tests**: ✅
   - Implemented comprehensive integration tests for:
     - Game initialization and setup
     - Spades breaking rules
     - Trick winning logic
     - Player strategy decisions
     - Unusual card distributions
     - Error handling and edge cases
   - Created 6 new integration test files with 30+ test cases
   - Verified interactions between multiple components
   - Tested edge cases like unusual card distributions
   - Ensured proper error handling for invalid plays

8. **Final Verification and Documentation**: ✅
   - Verified all fixes work in actual gameplay
   - Updated documentation to reflect changes:
     - Created comprehensive testing-notes.md with guidance for testing the Spades game
     - Updated CHANGELOG.md to document new testing documentation
     - Updated README.md to reference the new testing documentation
   - Fixed integration test issues:
     - Updated gameInitialization.test.js to properly handle jokers in card validation
     - Ensured tests use imported RANKS constant instead of hardcoded values
     - Fixed card sorting logic to properly handle jokers
   - All tests are now passing in the QUnit test suite

### Longer-Term Goals

1. **Improve Playability**:
   - Improve the visual and interaction experience, ensuring smooth animations and card displays.
   - Ensure the game UI clearly displays the trick history, the cards played by each player, and the state of the game at any time.

2. **Multiplayer Integration**:
   - Research the feasibility of adding multiplayer functionality. If it is possible to implement, start working on server-client communication to allow for networked play.
   - The game could evolve into a multiplayer version based on the initial single-player design.

3. **Refine Game Rules and Complexity**:
   - Consider adding more advanced features such as the inclusion of Jokers (Big and Extra), along with the exclusion of 2 of Clubs and 2 of Hearts, as per the updated rules.
   - Refine the existing rule set to ensure balance and fairness, based on player feedback.

4. **State Management Improvements**:
   - Consider implementing a dedicated GameState engine to centralize state management
   - This would provide a single source of truth for game state
   - Would make state transitions more explicit and easier to track
   - Could include state for spades breaking, bidding, scoring, and game progression

## Key Challenges and Considerations

- **AI Decision-Making**: Currently, the computer players use a simplistic strategy. Improving this strategy, using the **Strategy Pattern**, is a priority for enhancing gameplay.
  
- **UI/UX**: The user interface needs to be clearer, with better card visibility and an intuitive play flow. Handling animations and ensuring that the game state is clearly communicated to the player is essential for a smooth experience.

- **Rule Enforcement**: While the rules are mostly in place, the enforcement of suit-following and invalid plays needs to be more robust. Ensuring that players cannot break the rules is critical for maintaining game integrity.

## Conclusion

This project is progressing well, with foundational elements like the game rules and testing framework in place. The immediate focus will be on fixing the current gameplay issues, improving the user experience, and refining the AI strategy. In the long term, the project will evolve into a more complex and feature-rich game, potentially including multiplayer support.
