# Progress - Spades (Single Player Implementation)

This document provides a summary of the current progress, goals, and future steps in the development of the Spades game, based on the context outlined in the previous files (Game Rules, System Patterns, Technical Context).

## Current Progress

### Game Development

- **Game Rules Implementation**: 
  - The core game rules are mostly implemented but still require refinement. The rules for suit-following, trumping, and trick-winning are working, but there are known issues with gameplay behavior:
    - The human player cannot see what was played in a trick clearly, and cards disappear too quickly after being played.
    - Inappropriate plays (such as off-suit plays when the player holds cards in the led suit) are still allowed.
  - The rules need to be fixed to make sure invalid moves are not allowed, and the player’s experience is improved.

- **Card Logic**:
  - Card comparison and game flow are functioning based on the rules, but the computer players' strategies need further testing and refinement. The current strategy is based on simple logic and could be expanded to use more complex patterns (as mentioned in the system patterns document).

- **UI/UX**:
  - After a card is played, the card should remain visible until the next trick begins, but this behavior is not fully implemented.
  - The game’s current UI does not clearly show what cards have been played, making it difficult to follow the flow of the game.
  - The animations for showing the winning card are not yet in place, which is an important feature for a smooth user experience.

### Testing and Automation

- **QUnit Testing Framework**:
  - Successfully migrated from the custom testing framework to QUnit for more robust testing capabilities.
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the migration process in `/docs/test-migration-guide.md`.
  - Added an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `/docs/adr/001-migration-to-qunit.md` to document the decision and implementation plan.
  - Implemented sample QUnit tests for both unit testing (`js/test/qunit/card.test.js`) and integration testing (`js/test/qunit/integration/trickFlow.test.js`).
  - Fixed integration tests for "Complete trick flow with rule enforcement" and "Winning card determination and animation" that were previously failing.
  - All tests now run through a Python server on port 8000 as documented in `/docs/browserServerConfig.md`.
  
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - The integration tests now properly validate game flow, including:
    - Rule enforcement for leading with Spades
    - Card selection and play validation
    - Winning card determination and animation
    - Books counting and team score updates
  
- **Test Infrastructure**:
  - Established a clear pattern for writing QUnit tests with proper setup and teardown.
  - Added support for asynchronous testing to handle animations and timing-dependent operations.
  - Improved test isolation to prevent test interference.

## Goals Moving Forward

### Immediate Goals

1. **Complete QUnit Migration**:
   - Migrate remaining unit tests to QUnit framework
   - Replace the original test.html with the QUnit version once all tests are migrated
   - Add more comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

2. **Fix Existing Game Rules**:
   - Ensure the card visibility issue is resolved (cards should stay visible until the trick ends).
   - Implement stricter rule enforcement to prevent invalid plays.
   - Add animations or visual cues to highlight the winning card of a trick.

3. **Improve AI Strategy**:
   - Refine the computer players' strategy (currently implemented with basic logic) to make the game more engaging.
   - Investigate the use of **Strategy Pattern** to allow for more varied and intelligent decision-making by the AI players.

### Longer-Term Goals

1. **Improve Playability**:
   - Improve the visual and interaction experience, ensuring smooth animations and card displays.
   - Ensure the game UI clearly displays the trick history, the cards played by each player, and the state of the game at any time.

2. **Multiplayer Integration**:
   - Research the feasibility of adding multiplayer functionality. If it is possible to implement, start working on server-client communication to allow for networked play.
   - The game could evolve into a multiplayer version based on the initial single-player design.

3. **Refine Game Rules and Complexity**:
   - Consider adding more advanced features such as the inclusion of Jokers (Big and Extra), along with the exclusion of 2 of Clubs and 2 of Hearts, as per the updated rules.
   - Refine the existing rule set to ensure balance and fairness, based on player feedback.

## Key Challenges and Considerations

- **AI Decision-Making**: Currently, the computer players use a simplistic strategy. Improving this strategy, using the **Strategy Pattern**, is a priority for enhancing gameplay.
  
- **UI/UX**: The user interface needs to be clearer, with better card visibility and an intuitive play flow. Handling animations and ensuring that the game state is clearly communicated to the player is essential for a smooth experience.

- **Rule Enforcement**: While the rules are mostly in place, the enforcement of suit-following and invalid plays needs to be more robust. Ensuring that players cannot break the rules is critical for maintaining game integrity.

## Conclusion

This project is progressing well, with foundational elements like the game rules and testing framework in place. The immediate focus will be on fixing the current gameplay issues, improving the user experience, and refining the AI strategy. In the long term, the project will evolve into a more complex and feature-rich game, potentially including multiplayer support.
