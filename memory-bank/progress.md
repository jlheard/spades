# Progress - Spades (Single Player Implementation)

This document provides a summary of the current progress, goals, and future steps in the development of the Spades game, based on the context outlined in the previous files (Game Rules, System Patterns, Technical Context).

## Current Progress

### Game Development

- **Game Rules Implementation**: 
  - The core game rules are mostly implemented but we've identified specific issues during gameplay testing:
    - **Critical Bug**: Players cannot play spades when they don't have the leading suit (clubs), which contradicts the game rules.
    - **UI Issue**: The winning card animation works, but the value of the card isn't displayed properly.
  - These issues need to be fixed to ensure the game follows the official rules as documented in `docs/gameRules.md`.

- **Card Logic**:
  - Card comparison and game flow are functioning based on the rules, but there are edge cases that aren't handled correctly.
  - The rule that "If a player has no cards in the suit led, they may play any card, including jokers and spades" is not being properly enforced.

- **UI/UX**:
  - The winning card animation (gold glow and pulse) works correctly, but the card value doesn't display properly during the animation.
  - The game's current UI does not clearly show what cards have been played, making it difficult to follow the flow of the game.

### Testing and Automation

- **QUnit Migration Completed**:
  - Successfully migrated from the custom testing framework to QUnit.
  - Created comprehensive documentation for the migration process in `/docs/test-migration-guide.md`.
  - Added an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `/docs/adr/001-migration-to-qunit.md`.
  - Implemented sample QUnit tests for both unit and integration testing.
  - Fixed integration tests for "Complete trick flow with rule enforcement" and "Winning card determination and animation".
  - All tests now run through a Python server on port 8000 as documented in `/docs/browserServerConfig.md`.
  
- **Test Coverage Gaps Identified**: 
  - Despite passing tests, gameplay testing revealed issues that weren't caught by our test suite.
  - Need to add specific tests for edge cases like playing spades when the player has no cards of the leading suit.
  - Need to add tests for UI elements and animations to ensure they display correctly.

## Goals Moving Forward

### Immediate Goals (Updated April 12, 2025)

1. **Complete Unit Test Suite**: ✅
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all core components
   - Tested all public methods and key functionality
   - Ensured test coverage for all game logic
   - Used manual verification to track test coverage
   - All tests are now passing

2. **Fix Rule Enforcement Issues**: ✅
   - Created specific tests for the identified rule enforcement bug
   - Fixed the logic in `LegalPlayRules.isCardLegalToPlay()` and related methods
   - Ensured players can play spades when they don't have the leading suit
   - Verified the fix works in both tests and actual gameplay

3. **Improve UI/Animation**: ✅
   - Fixed the failing integration test for player positions
   - Fixed the card value display during winning animations
   - Enhanced the winning card animation for better visibility
   - Ensured card content remains visible throughout animations
   - Added "WINNER" label to winning card animation

4. **Fixed Card Comparison Logic**: ✅
   - Fixed bug in `cardComparer.js` where the highest spade wasn't correctly identified when multiple spades were present
   - Updated the logic to correctly compare cards of the same suit
   - Ensured the Ace of Spades wins when multiple spades are present

4. **Create Integration Tests**:
   - Implement tests for common gameplay scenarios
   - Test the interaction between multiple components
   - Verify that all components work together correctly
   - Test edge cases and unusual card distributions

5. **Final Verification and Documentation**:
   - Verify all fixes work in actual gameplay
   - Update documentation to reflect changes
   - Create a test report documenting test coverage
   - Document any remaining issues or limitations

### Longer-Term Goals

1. **Improve Playability**:
   - Improve the visual and interaction experience, ensuring smooth animations and card displays.
   - Ensure the game UI clearly displays the trick history, the cards played by each player, and the state of the game at any time.

2. **Multiplayer Integration**:
   - Research the feasibility of adding multiplayer functionality. If it is possible to implement, start working on server-client communication to allow for networked play.
   - The game could evolve into a multiplayer version based on the initial single-player design.

3. **Refine Game Rules and Complexity**:
   - Consider adding more advanced features such as the inclusion of Jokers (Big and Extra), along with the exclusion of 2 of Clubs and 2 of Hearts, as per the updated rules.
   - Refine the existing rule set to ensure balance and fairness, based on player feedback.

## Key Challenges and Considerations

- **AI Decision-Making**: Currently, the computer players use a simplistic strategy. Improving this strategy, using the **Strategy Pattern**, is a priority for enhancing gameplay.
  
- **UI/UX**: The user interface needs to be clearer, with better card visibility and an intuitive play flow. Handling animations and ensuring that the game state is clearly communicated to the player is essential for a smooth experience.

- **Rule Enforcement**: While the rules are mostly in place, the enforcement of suit-following and invalid plays needs to be more robust. Ensuring that players cannot break the rules is critical for maintaining game integrity.

## Conclusion

This project is progressing well, with foundational elements like the game rules and testing framework in place. The immediate focus will be on fixing the current gameplay issues, improving the user experience, and refining the AI strategy. In the long term, the project will evolve into a more complex and feature-rich game, potentially including multiplayer support.
