# Technical Context - Spades (Single Player Implementation)

This document provides an overview of the technical context and the tools/technologies used in the development of the Spades game, with a focus on the core technologies and the custom testing framework employed for validating the game's rules and functionality.

## Core Technologies

### HTML5 & JavaScript

- **HTML5** is used for building the user interface (UI), including rendering the game board, cards, and interactive elements.
- **JavaScript** is the core language that drives game logic, handles player inputs, manages the game state, and communicates with the UI.
- Both HTML5 and JavaScript are chosen for their versatility and wide support across browsers, making the game accessible to a broad audience without requiring complex installations or plugins.
  
#### Key Features:
- **Canvas API** is utilized for rendering dynamic game graphics (cards, animations, etc.).
- **DOM Manipulation** is used for handling user interactions (card clicks, turn order, etc.).
- **Event Listeners** manage user input and game flow.
- The game is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on different screen sizes.

## Custom Testing Framework

### Overview

The custom testing framework is designed to validate the game’s rules, logic, and player interactions. It is specifically built to test the key components of the Spades game, including card gameplay, turn order, rule enforcement, and UI behavior.

- The framework is located in the `js/test` directory and is integral for testing both unit and integration levels of the game.

### Features of the Testing Framework

- **Unit Tests** focus on testing individual game logic components like card comparison, player actions, and rules enforcement.
- **Integration Tests** validate the interaction between various components (e.g., the gameplay logic, the AI decision-making, and the UI).
- **Automation**: Tests are run automatically during development, ensuring that changes to the codebase don’t break existing functionality.

#### Example Testing Strategy

1. **Card Comparison**: Ensure that the rules for comparing cards in each trick are functioning correctly (e.g., spades beat other suits, highest card wins).
2. **AI Strategy Testing**: Test the AI’s decision-making process for selecting cards to play based on hand and game state.
3. **UI Testing**: Verify that the correct cards are displayed, and that the game flow is smooth (e.g., players can see the cards played, the game state updates appropriately).

#### Automation Setup and Environment Configuration

###### Python Server for Browser Testing

When executing browser-related tests, it is crucial to ensure that the Python server is running on **port 8000**. The server should be started before any tests that require browser interaction, and it should be stopped after the tests are complete.

For detailed instructions on how to start and stop the Python server, please refer to the **[Python Browser Server Configuration](docs/browserServerConfig.md)**.

###### Automation Flow:

1. **Start Python Server**:
   - Before running browser tests, execute the command `python -m http.server 8000` to start the server.
  
2. **Test Execution**:
   - Run the tests related to browser functionality.
  
3. **Stop Python Server**:
   - After the tests are finished, stop the server using **Ctrl+C**.

The proper server setup ensures that the Python-based backend is available for the frontend (browser) interactions during testing.

## Integration in the Cline System

Ensure that the Cline system automates the starting and stopping of the server as part of the testing process. The system should check for the server's availability before running browser tests and ensure it’s stopped afterward to avoid conflicts with other tasks or services.


### Integration with Cline

- The testing framework is integrated with **Cline** to automate the testing process, track changes, and ensure that the game logic evolves correctly as the game grows in complexity.

## Future Considerations

- As the game moves from a single-player to a multiplayer format, there may be a need to enhance the testing framework to support server-client interactions, networked games, and multiplayer game rules.
- The HTML5 and JavaScript technologies used in the project allow for easy transitions into a server-based version in the future if the project evolves to support multiplayer gameplay.
