# Python Browser Server Configuration

This document contains instructions for setting up and running a Python server to facilitate browser testing. It also defines when to start and stop it during testing.

## Server Setup and Usage

1. **Start the Python Server**:
    - The server should be started on **port 8000** to facilitate communication between the Python backend and the browser-based frontend.
    - The server must be launched before any tests involving the browser can be executed.

    **Command to Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

2. **Stop the Python Server**:
    - After the browser functionality has been observed and tests are complete, the Python server should be stopped to release the port and conclude the testing session.
  
    **Command to Stop the Server**:
    - You can stop the Python server by using **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where it's running.

3. **Usage Notes**:
    - Ensure that the Python server is active before performing any browser interactions. Cline should start the server as part of the testing routine and stop it when the testing concludes.
    - Cline must verify that the browser is correctly connected to the Python server during testing.
  
4. **Memory Usage**:
    - When working with the browser functionality, the Python server should be started automatically to simulate the real-world environment where the frontend communicates with the backend.

## Configuration in Memory Bank

The instructions to start and stop the Python server can be integrated into Clineâ€™s test execution process, ensuring that the necessary environment is set up before any tests are performed.
